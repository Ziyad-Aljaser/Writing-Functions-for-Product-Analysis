# Project Description

## Overview:
The goal of this project is to assist Brenda, a Product Analyst, in streamlining and automating her data analysis process by writing some efficient functions. Brenda has been working with Net Promoter Score (NPS) data, which measures customer satisfaction and loyalty by asking users to rate their likelihood of recommending a product to friends or colleagues on a scale of 0 to 10. The data is collected through various channels such as emails, mobile app pop-ups, and website pop-ups.

## Problem:
Brenda's current method of compiling NPS data from different sources involves writing repetitive code, making the process time-consuming and prone to errors. She is seeking a more efficient solution to handle data aggregation and analysis.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a solution that automates the process of collecting, aggregating, and analyzing NPS data from various sources. This will save Brenda time and effort while reducing the risk of errors. The solution should be flexible and adaptable, allowing for easy integration with different data sources and formats.

## Key Components:
1. Data Collection: Design a system to automatically retrieve NPS data from different sources like emails, mobile app pop-ups, and website pop-ups.
2. Data Aggregation: Create a unified and standardized data structure to combine the collected data from various sources.
3. Data Analysis: Implement an analysis module to derive insights from the aggregated NPS data, including calculating the overall score and identifying trends.
4. Scalability and Flexibility: Ensure the solution is designed in a way that can easily accommodate additional data sources and adapt to changes in existing sources.

By creating this automated solution for NPS data aggregation and analysis, Brenda will be able to focus more on interpreting the results and making data-driven decisions to improve the product experience for customers.
